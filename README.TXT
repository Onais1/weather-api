THIS IS MY DESIGN OF A SIMPLE WEATHER API, 

IT CONTAINS WEATHER DATA OF ANY COUNTRY A USER WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

THE DATA USED WAS SOURCED FROM A REPUTABLE WEBSITE KNOWN AS OPEN WEATHER MAP.ORG

THE WEBSITE HAS BEEN DESIGNED SIMPLY BUT FLAWLESSLY TO BE EFFECTIVE AND EASY TO USE.
THE EASY TO USE INTERFACE ALLOWS USERS TO TYPE IN +DATA EFFORTLESSLY
USERS WILL BE ABLE TO KNOW THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF THAT CITY
AS WELL AS A DESCRIPTIVE IDEA OF WHAT THE WEATHER FEELS LIKE.

THIS PROJECT IS STILL TO BE UPDATED AND ADVANCED
TO MEET ALL USER PREFERENCES,
ONE OF THE NEXT MAJOR UPDATES WILL BE ALLOWING USERS TO 
SEE THE WEATHER IN THEIR AREA WITHOUT THEM INPUTING ANY DATA
A FEATURE CALLED GEOLOCATION WILL BE INTRODUCED IN THIS 
NEXT STEP.

HAVE FUN///...
